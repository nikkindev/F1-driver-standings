Python scripts to get driver standings data from the Formula 1 website.

**Package contains two files:**

* F1driverstandings_complete.py - To create .txt files for all the years automatically when the script is run

**Requirements:**
* python
* BeautifulSoup module (http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/download/4.0/)

**Tip:**
The .txt file can be saved as .csv file since the data in .txt files are already comma separated.
